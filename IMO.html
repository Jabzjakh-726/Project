        <h2>What is IMO Olympaid</h2>
        <p>The International Math Olympiad (IMO) is a prestigious mathematical competition conducted 
            for school kids at the international level. It is organised annually by the 
            SOF - Science Olympiad Foundation in which kids from around the world compete
             in solving challenging mathematical problems. The aim of the IMO Olympiad is to 
             identify and encourage students who have a talent and aptitude for mathematics, and
              to provide them with a platform to showcase their skills.</p>
