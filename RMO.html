          The Homi Bhabha Center of Science Education (HBCSE) conducts the exam to encourage young
           minds in the field of Mathematics. They will eventually represent India in the International Mathematical Olympiad program.</p><br>
    <p>
        For RMO Eligibility, an applicant has to clear the Pre RMO Exams at the first level of the International Mathematics Olympiad.
         From an All India regional level test to a national level, RMO is the stepping stone which leads to international glory for the 
         participants from our country.
