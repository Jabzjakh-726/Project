       <h2>JEE Advanced Eligibility on the Basis of Class 12 Board Exams or Other Equivalent Exams
    </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The applicants should have cleared Class 12 board exams or any other equivalent exam in 2022. Applicants appearing for the 2023 board exams are also eligible. Candidates who had appeared in the Class 12 (or equivalent) examination for the first time in 2021 or earlier are NOT eligible to appear in the JEE Advanced 2023.
        </li>
        <li>Students are eligible to appear for JEE Advanced if the results of their Class 12 board exams or any other equivalent examination for the academic year 2023 were declared after June 2023. Note: By appearance in the Class 12 (or equivalent) examination, it is meant that the board concerned declared the result for that year irrespective of whether or not the examination was conducted. It would be considered as an appearance even if the result of a particular candidate got withheld.</li>
         <li>However, suppose the examination board of Class 12 (or equivalent) declared the results for the academic year 2020-21 on or after October 15, 2021. In that case, the candidates of that board who appeared for their Class 12 exam in 2021 are also eligible to appear in the JEE (Advanced) 2023, provided they meet all the other eligibility criteria. If the examination board of Class 12 (or equivalent) declared the results for the academic year 2020- 21 before October 15, 2021, but the result of a particular candidate was withheld, then the candidate will not be eligible to appear in JEE (Advanced) 2023.</li>
