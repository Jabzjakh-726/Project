        <h2>Who is eligible for the GMAT? </h2>
        <p>Any candidate, who wants to apply for management programmes and is 18 years or above (if a candidate is between 13 and 17 years, he/she may appear for the GMAT after providing written approval or consent by his/her legal guardians or parents), can apply for the GMAT exam 2023. What is the GMAT eligibility criteria? There are no specific GMAT eligibility criteria set by the GMAC except for the one related to age, i.e. anyone who is 18 years or above can appear for the GMAT exam and those who are less than 18 need to provide a signed GMAT Parental Consent/Authorization form. The majority of the GMAT applicants are either students or professionals while many are final-year students. However, one can take the GMAT even if it does not fall under any of these categories. Whether, it is according to age, nationality, qualification, work experience, or language requirements, we have mentioned the GMAT eligibility in detail in this article. Usually, candidates who completed their bachelor's or those who are in their final year go for the GMAT. Apart from this, working professionals also go for the GMAT.</p>
        <h2>About GMAT</h2>
        <p>The Graduate Management Admission Test also known as GMAT is mostly taken by MBA aspirants who wish to study abroad. This exam evaluates the candidates on the basis of their Integrated Reasoning skills, Quantitative skills, Verbal skills, and Analytical Writing Assessment. The interesting structure and pattern of this exam make it really tough and exciting at the same time. Due to the course structure of this exam, some aspirants often get confused as to which exam will fulfil their MBA requirements better: GMAT or GRE. It is essential for them to understand that recognised business schools worldwide use the GMAT score to evaluate a candidate’s profile and conclude their admission. In this article, we will inform you of everything about GMAT eligibility and GMAT eligibility criteria.</p>
        <p>GMAC has launched the GMAT Focus Edition 2023. GMAT Focus Edition release date for the official prep will be on 6 June 2023. GMAT Focus Edition registrations will open on 29 August 2023. The current version of the GMAT exam will be available until at least early 2024. Hence, candidates will have the option to register for both the GMAT exam formats from 29 August 2023 onwards. In addition, GMAT Focus Edition testing is scheduled to begin in Q4 of 2023. The GMAT eligibility criteria for the GMAT Focus Edition are not expected to be different from the current version of the GMAT exam 2023.</p>
        <h2>Age Limit for GMAT</h2>
        <p>There is no upper age limit for the GMAT exam. For the minimum age limit, GMAC has defined that the candidates need to be at least 18 years. However, it has been reported that aspirants that fall in the age group of 13 to 17 are also allowed to attempt the exam given that they have written approval or consent provided by their legal guardians or parents (also called as an NOC).</p>
        <h2>Language Requirements for GMAT</h2>
        <p>When we talk of the GMAT eligibility criteria with respect to language requirements, we find that students can appear for the GMAT exam 2023 even if they do not belong to an English-medium school or college/university. The GMAT exam is designed to be attempted in English; hence basic understanding and fluency in the language is a must for the aspirants. In order to clear the exam, one must have the skills to comprehend the twisted and confusing questions asked in the exam. The exam is tough and complicated; henceforth, aspirants must have an excellent command of the English language.</p>
        <h2>GMAT Eligibility Criteria 2023: Academic Qualification</h2>
        <p>When it comes to the GMAT eligibility with respect to academic qualifications, we find that GMAC, the organizing body of the GMAT has officially not set any academic eligibility requirements for taking the GMAT exam. As such candidates need not have any minimum qualification or degree for taking the GMAT. However, the majority of the test-takers are final-year undergraduate students or working professionals willing to take up a management course further. Even if the candidates don't fall under this category they can still appear for the exam. However, students must note that GMAT eligibility criteria 2023 are different from that of MBA college admissions. Most MBA colleges require an undergraduate degree as the minimum academic qualification.</p>
        <h2>GMAT Score Eligibility</h2>
        <p>The eligibility for the GMAT with respect to work experience is different from that of B-School admissions. Many working professionals attempt the GMAT exam; however, one need not have any work experience to take the GMAT. Having relevant work experience will always give you an added advantage while applying to a B-school, however, there are no work experience eligibility criteria to take the GMAT.</p>
        <h2>Other Restrictions With Respect To the GMAT Eligibility Criteria</h2>
        <p>According to the GMAC, any individual irrespective of gender, age, nationality, religion, academic background, etc. can appear for the exam without any discrimination. This includes differently-abled candidates as well, who are provided with special exam accommodation upon request. For such aspirants, the medical documents that define a candidate’s disability are put confidential, which has been thoroughly described in the privacy statement declared by the GMAC.</p>
